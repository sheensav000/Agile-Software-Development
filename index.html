              <h1>What is Agile Software Development?</h1>
              <p>
                Agile is a methodology commonly used within software development
                that prioritizes customer feedback, faster delivery times,
                setting priorities, and reducing waste.
              </p>
            </div>
          </header>

          <div class="section">
            <h2>Why is Agile important?</h2>
            <p>
              Software developers found that they were frustrated by spending so
              much time working on their code and fixing every bug while
              completing a lot of documentation. They felt like this was a waste
              of time. With Agile, work is done in short iterations. The
              features and products that come out are not perfect. However, this
              brings more feedback directly from customers and developers can
              quickly make changes and release new features.
            </p>
            <p>
              These iterations are also called the Agile Software Development
              Life Cycle and are repeated in sprints. These sprints last from
              2-4 weeks.
            </p>
          </div>

          <div class="section">
            <h2>What does this look like?</h2>
            <p>
              The most popular framework within Agile is Scrum. Scrum focuses on
              collaboration within teams to complete the product backlog.
            </p>
            <p>
              First, the team leader will meet with shareholders to look at all
              of the possible projects to be completed and the priority of those
              projects are decided.
            </p>
            <p>
              Then, the team leader meets with their Scrum team of software
              developers to split projects into small tasks.
            </p>
            <p>
              Individually, the software developers decide what they can
              complete in a sprint and are in charge of those tasks. Teams meet
              for daily standups that are only 15 minutes long to hold each
              other accountable.
            </p>
            <p>
              Lastly, at the end of each iteration, teams meet to take a
              retrospective look at the sprint. They may receive feedback that
              the current project is not something customers want anymore and
              they will pivot to a different project and release new features
              that customers do want.
            </p>
            <p>Agile is highly adaptable to change.</p>

              <span class="bold"
                >Agile Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC):</span
              >
              Each iteration consists of six steps. Requirements, Design,
              Development, Testing, Deployment, and Review. Learn more about
              what these mean by hovering over the relative box.
            </p>
            <p>
              <span class="bold">Sprint:</span>
              Sprints are a set period of time, typically 2-4 weeks for each
              iteration of the Software Development Life Cycle.
            </p>
            <p>
              <span class="bold">Kanban:</span>

              Kanban allows to visually see tasks on Kanban cards to see the
              tasks to be completed and their progress. Within Agile, these
              cards are typically used on a Kanban board.
            </p>
            <p>
              <span class="bold">Scrum:</span>

              Scrum is a popular framework within Agile that promotes working in
              short cycles, delivering often, meeting daily, and managing a
              backlog.
            </p>
            <p>
              <span class="bold">Scrum Master:</span>

              The Scrum Master facilitates the team by managing the product
              backlog (see below) and encouraging the use of Agile Scrum
              principles.
            </p>
            <p>
              <span class="bold">Product Backlog:</span>

              The product backlog is the list, set by priority, of the tasks to
              be completed in a sprint. Backlogs are organized by the Scrum
              Master, with input from stakeholders.

          <div class="section">
            <h2>Is Agile only used for software development?</h2>
            <p>
              Nope! There are several ways that Agile can be implemented, not
              only in business, but at home and in personal life as well.
            </p>
            <p>
              Consider how this can be used in a classroom setting. If you're
              working on a school project, getting continuous feedback can
              really improve your final submission.
            </p>
            <p>
              If you're working on a large project, you write the thesis first,
              get feedback on that part, then quickly write and revise your body
              paragraphs. Finally, the conclusion is written once you have a
              polished essay after implementing comments from peers.

            <h2>How was Agile used to complete this project?</h2>
            <p>
              I had two weeks to complete this project. These two weeks could be
              considered one sprint. Then, I release the product by submitting
              it and getting feedback from peers, TAs, and instructors. There
              are a couple ways to approach the next sprint. I could take the
              feedback to improve this project. However, doing more work for
              this project may not be in the best interest for my grade or
              learning, and I would move on to complete another project. A key
              element of Agile is being adaptable to change and quickly
              producing high-quality work.
            </p>
            <p>
              Additionally, the most important parts of the project should be
              prioritized first with smaller, less important features done last.
              With this project, I first completed Level 1 Research to get an
              overview of the topic. Then, I found a template for the website
              and formatted the main page how I wanted it so I knew what
              direction I wanted to go with my Level 2 Research. The next task
              was completing Level 2 Research. I added the graphic to the page
              and matched the squares to the graphic with titles and color. The
              content of the page was next. Then, smaller features like font
              size, styling, and paragraph breaks came last.
            </p>
            <p>
              Using Agile to create this website helped me create a high quality
              product in a short amount of time by focusing on the most
              important parts first.
